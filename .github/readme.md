### About üí¨

Over the years, I've redesigned my website many times. Whenever I see something new that catches my eye, I want to incorporate it into my site. This time, I'd like to use `zola`.

### The Colorscheme üé®

Since all of my desktops use the [`catppuccin`][catppuccin] colorscheme, I want to use it here as well. I hope to become a member of [`ctp-webring`][ctp-webring] soon.

### Tips üç¶

-   On [`NIX`][Nix] , run `nix develop` to enter a shell with all `deps`.
-   Run `Nix develop .#lychee` to check for broken links
