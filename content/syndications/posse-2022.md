## The 2022

My 2022 was an extraordinary year for me. I launched [`METISLinux`][metislinux], a project I'm
proud of, reflecting my dedication. I also met a diverse group of individuals
at [`Threatcon`][threatcon], gaining valuable connections and insights.

Academically, I completed my +2 in major science with excellent grades. I
received recognition from the Dutch government and a letter of appreciation
from Cambridge University for my bug reports. I also earned the eJPT
certification and started learning Rust.

Reuniting with old online friends in person was a highlight, contributing to my
personal and professional growth.

Overall, 2022 was a year of progress and achievements. I'm excited for the
future. See you next year!

Ba-bye!
