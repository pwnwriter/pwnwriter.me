## Answering what am i upto?

Uwuuuuuu, My 2022 was an extraordinary year. One of the major accomplishments was the launch of my project, METISLinux. It was an achievement that I am proud of as it represents the effort and commitment I have put into it. I also had the privilege to meet a diverse group of individuals at Threatcon " The hacker's conference ", which provided me with valuable connections and learning opportunities.


My studies in 2022 were also noteworthy. I successfully completed my +2 in major science with excellent grades. Additionally, I received recognition from the Dutch government in the form of swags and a letter of appreciation from Cambridge University for my bug reports. Furthermore, I attained eJPT certification with high scores and embarked on learning Rust.

Lastly, I was delighted to reunite with old online friends in person. These experiences have been formative and have helped me to grow both personally and professionally.

Overall, 2022 was a year of progression and achievements for me and I am excited to see what the future holds.

This is it for this time ig, see ya next year... Ba - byeee
