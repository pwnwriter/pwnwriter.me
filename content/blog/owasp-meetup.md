[OWASP][owasp] is a non-profit open-source foundation focused on application
security. They have local and global [chapters][chapters] around the world
aimed at improving community security. We also have a local chapter called
OWASP Kathmandu, which organizes events to spread awareness within Nepal. I had
the privilege to speak at OWASP Kathmandu 0x03, where I presented my tool,
[Halyxon][haylxon].


If you do not know what haylxon is, simple, it's a tool to take screenshots of webpages 
from terminal using chrome's headless feature written in Rust! 

You can simply take a screenshot of a webpage as below!

```bash
hxn -b <path/to/chrome/bin> -u https://example.com
```

But wait, you could do that by just opening a browser and pressing some holy keys?

I mean yeah? but what would you do when you have `hundreds` of urls, sub(domains) to take?

#### Background

There were already tools like [Eyewitness] and [Gowitness], which I had used,
but they either felt slow or lacked my personal touch. Since I wanted to learn
Rust, it was the perfect time to start a new project, especially since I
already had a basic knowledge of Rust.

#### Usages
Haylxon comes with a lot of options now, reading urls from `stdin`, `defining
ports`, `running arbitary javascript` and a lot more.

![][hxn]

You can pass a file containing a list of urls, and define height, width and
even a deplayed screenshot is possible. 

One of the most interesting usages of this tools is that, you can run it on `github` actions 
to take screenshot of your subdomain, zip that out upload to [0x0.st][0x0] or your own instance.

I guess it's this for now.
