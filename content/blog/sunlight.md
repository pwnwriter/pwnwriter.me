I would paint your pictures with the rainbow,  
Just to catch your eye’s gentle light.  
I would gather all the warmth of the sun,  
To hold you close and make everything right.  

The revels and beauty of nature’s embrace,  
Cannot rival your radiant smile.  
Wherever you journey, I wish to follow,  
And love you with every mile.
