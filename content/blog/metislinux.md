This!, exactly 2 years ago on my 18th birthday, I launched
[`metislinux`][metislinux-git] a beautiful runit based linux distro. I had fun
working on this project with a few other[`guys`][contrib].

MetisLinux was essentially my own desktop, featuring a GUI installer and three
custom-managed package sources: _Andromeda, Cosmic, and Recon_. While working on
this project, I received tremendous support from the Plan9 community on Matrix
and many others. I wanna thank you guys wholeheartly <3.

#### The why

I've planed a lot to bring in metislinux. I've even wrote a package manager
[hysp][hysp], a custom bar for wayland [heliumbar][heliumbar] in rust btw, but
then i started working, I had to use `Apple silicon` for my work, had my
universities starting soon. Balancing my personal life and the project has
become increasingly challenging, making it difficult to continue the project
and hence the project has been archived.


#### The future

Although the project will no longer receive updates, all our work remains
available at [github/metis-os][metislinux-git] under the [MIT][MIT] License. The code,
resources, and tools are free for you to use and build upon. Feel free to fork
it, learn from it, or create something new.

To everyone involved in Metislinux; whether you contributed code, reported bugs,
shared feedback, or simply used it—thank you! Your support has been invaluable,
and I couldn’t have achieved this without you.
