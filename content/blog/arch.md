Switching to Linux was soo easy....    
Btw, switching to Arch is  crazy..      
Yo Yooooo.  
'CLI' was massive.  
I felt Soo aggressive.  
  
Never had soo tension..  
Switching to win wasn't my intention  
I felt the pain..  
Ended up with no gain.  
  
I felt Soo lately..  
Finally, entered 'GUI' greatly.  
I pressed enter & go.  
GUI was  nice tho!  
Ever since I started using.  
The peace was missing.  
  
I switched to arch.  
Took January to march.  
I stopped distro hoping.  
Now just being De Hoppp..  
  
I wasn't wasting my  time.  
It seems like a crime?  
Yo yoooooo.  
Let them go bad.  
Arch wiki cares if you're sad.  
  
Don't be serious.  
Be curious,   
Go dark.  
Use arch ;)
