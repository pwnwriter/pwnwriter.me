Staying silent is powerful. Not every question needs an answer. Not every
comment deserves a reply. And not every situation needs your voice in it.

When youâ€™re quiet, you notice more , not just what people say, but how they
feel. You give yourself space to think before reacting, and you avoid saying
things you might later regret.

Remaining silent sometime helped me to focus on what really matters. It gives me time to
reflect and keeps me out of unnecessary conflicts.

Not every moment needs words. Sometimes, silence says more !
