I spend a lot of time building, breaking, and rebuilding software, so my workspace matters.

For the past two years, I’ve been using Nix on my MacBook and NixOS as a daily driver. Everything is declarative, reproducible, and easy to roll back when experiments go wrong.

Most of my work happens in the terminal and Neovim — for coding, notes, and writing. The setup is simple, predictable, and quiet.

Nothing fancy. Just cozy, reliable tools that stay out of the way.
