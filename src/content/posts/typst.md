My professor once asked, ***“Your assignments are so beautiful and polished — do
you spend a lot of time on them?”***  The truth? Not really. I just take my raw
class notes, add a few words to clean them up, and turn them into PDFs — much
faster than most of my classmates.

For my first two semesters, I used [Markdown] to write all my notes, organized
them with [Obsidian], kept them versioned with [Git] on [GitHub], and exported
them to PDF.  This workflow worked, but I was never completely satisfied with
Markdown’s limitations.

That’s why I’ve started exploring [Typst] — a modern, more powerful typesetting
system.  Although [HTML support] for Typst is still in development and I can’t
use it on my website yet, it has already made note-taking a much more enjoyable
experience.
