## Background

After high school, I was at home with my parents, doing errands and
self-learning while preparing for my __USA__ visa interview. Out of the blue, a
well-known company reached out with a job offer. Despite not getting the terms
I hoped for, I decided to take the opportunity.

## The job

There wasn't anything specifically like working on just one domain. I used to
manage linux server's, providing technical support and so on.

## what did i get..?

- The best boys:

    It’s probably impossible to find teammates who are both incredibly helpful and equally supportive and encouraging at the same time.

    Gotta miss them ♥

- A new opportunity :

    I was able to introduce [`nix`](https://nixos.org) across my teammates, Not
    just that but 3 of our production servers now use `nix` as a user level and
    `core` level.

    It was an absolutely fantastic opportunity for me to learn
    and apply Nix on servers according to user requirements, rather than just
    for personal projects.

    I believe that working to fulfill other’s needs teaches you more than
    working on personal projects alone.

- The Experience :

    While I’m a bit sad this is ending, we had an amazing time exploring different
    places. My first week alone was filled with tours and adventures. The office
    environment was incredibly friendly and helpful, which made the experience even
    better.

## Moving on

I've my __USA__ flight soon within a very few weeks. I took resign from the job
but i miss the boys i met there. They were absolute amazing people. I wish to
work with them later and forever.
