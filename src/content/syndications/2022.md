This year was amazing. I launched [METISLinux][metislinux] , met great people
at [Threatcon][threatcon], and finished +2 science with top grades. I got
recognized by the Dutch government and Cambridge for bug reports, earned eJPT,
and started learning Rust. Meeting old online friends in person was a
highlight. Excited for what’s next — see you next year!
