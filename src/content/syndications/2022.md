This year was amazing. I launched [METISLinux][metislinux], met great people
at [Threatcon][threatcon], and finished +2 science with some good grades. I got
recognized by the Dutch government and Cambridge for bug reports, earned eJPT,
and started learning Rust. Met some old online friends in real.

See yaa!
