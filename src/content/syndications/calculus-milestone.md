We just reached **1M+ members** in the Calculus group.

We started in **2021** with just **4 admins**, from different countries — and it’s honestly unreal to see how far this community has come.

Managing the posts and members at this scale has become challenging, but I’m truly grateful for the support, contributions, and kindness from everyone here.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
