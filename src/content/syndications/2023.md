I finally got to spend more time with my parents, staying home and helping at
ourshop near the school. I enjoyed chatting with people, playing cricket with
kids, and having fun with my brother even those foggy morning runs and
playing with goats. I also did a lot of open source work in Rust, writing [
haylxon][haylxon] and [hysp][hysp], and diving deep into Rust internals.
Like last year, I attended Threatcon again it was a blast. Bye!
